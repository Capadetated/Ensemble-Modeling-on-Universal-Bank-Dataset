A Ensemble Model predictive analysis of customers accepting a personal loan.

This was a SAS Enterprise Miner-based project using 15 models to predict whether customers would accept a personal loan from their bank. There were 3 SVMs, and 3 iterations of 4 model types: gradient boosting, random forest, boosting, and bagging. The best model (gradient boosting) generated a >95.6% accuracy and 99% sensitivty, improving accuracy of true positives from the baseline by 8%.
